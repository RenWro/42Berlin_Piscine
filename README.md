<h1 align="center">The 42 Berlin Piscine</h1>

The Piscine is the last phase before full admission to the 42 Berlin program. Itâ€™s 4 weeks long and designed to gear you up to learn the basics of programming with peers like you. The Piscine is a chance for you to learn programming from scratch or dive deeper into your skillset and find out whether 42 Berlin is a good fit for you. Think of the Piscine as a very condensed version of the curriculum, where you will trial out our methods, learn a lot of code & meet a lot of people. The Piscine is challenging and it will test the skills you have or want to create. This is all part of the ride. 

<h2>Immersive</h2>
For a month, you are encouraged to use 7 days a week to learn code and be fully immersed in our methods. After, you will know if 42 Berlin is for you.

<h2>Beginner-friendly</h2>
All experience levels welcomed. It is a very challenging experience, but the Piscine teaches code from scratch.

<h2>Self-development </h2>
Aside from learning how to code, the Piscine will teach you a lot about yourself. Interpersonal and technical challenges will throw you in the deep end of problem solving that is applicable to every part of life.
